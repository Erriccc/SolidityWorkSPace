## create an incentive system that rewards both customers and businesses for transacting with cryptocurrency instead of fiat.

## last update 2/5/2022

## deployment instructions

Spender interface requires a stablecoin(ERC20 address), and a reward token address(governance voting token).


## how it works:

users get minted a voting token everytime they transact with vendors in the ecosystem. 

Half of every transaction fee proccessed by the Spender Interface goes to a reward pool. 

users can then upvote or downvote vendors with the best cryptocurrency deals. 

vendors can then claim their rewards which is calculated by the ration of their votes to the total votes in the pool at the time. 

However, vendors are only allowed to claim a maximum reward of 10% to ensure there is always money in the pool for everybody. voting tokens get burned after the vendor claims them.

The rewards given to the vendors are intended to encourage them to offer more cryptocurrency friendly deals which in turn also benefits the users.
